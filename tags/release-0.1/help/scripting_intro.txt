Faint features an interactive interpreter for the Python programming language.\
To start the interpreter, select Python Console in the Edit menu (or press F8).
From this interpreter, most of what can be be done manually in Faint can be done
programatically.

This documentation only covers Python as it relates to Faint. For an
introduction to Python, see www.python.org.

Two simple examples on drawing from the interpreter and customizing
settings follow.

---
'Draw a 640x480 grid of 10x10 squares to the active image'\
{{{
<font face="courier">
for i in range(100):<br>
&nbsp; line( 0, i*10, 640, i * 10 ) # Horizontal lines<br>
&nbsp; line( i*10, 0, i*10, 480 ) # Vertical lines<br>
</font>
}}}
---
Typing the above code in the interpreter produces a grid of 10x10 pixel squares covering (0,0)-(640,480) in the
active drawing area.

The interpreter also allows customizing and extending Faint to make it
more effective for your work. The example below shows how a keyboard
key can be connected to several actions:
---
'Make the space-bar select the line tool, set line width to 10 and foreground color to blue'\
{{{
# A custom function that changes tool settings\
def example_function():<br>
&nbsp; tool(5)<br>
&nbsp; set_linewidth(10)<br>
&nbsp; set_fgcol(0,0,255)<br>
<br>
# Connecting the function to a key\
bind( example_function )
-&gt; [press key]
}}}

= The Faint ini file =
A user-specific python script file, .faint.py, is executed when Faint
starts. This allows storing custom functions and key binds. The
location of the ini file varies with operating systems. Fortunately,
the Faint Python Console (F8) lists the location for the used ini
file.
