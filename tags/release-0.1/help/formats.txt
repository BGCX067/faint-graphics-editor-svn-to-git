Faint can save images in a number of formats. Which format should be
used depends on the type of image and intended use. <p>

== Graphics Interchange Format (.gif) ==
A lossless raster format which limits the distinct colors in each
frame to 256. A gif can be animated, but Faint can't handle that!

The limited palette makes gifs unsuitable for photographs, but well
suited for simple sprites or clipart with few colors. When animation
is not required, png is generally a better alternative

== JPEG (.jpg) ==
A lossy raster format for photographs.

== Portable Network Graphics (.png) ==
A lossless raster format.

== Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg) ==
A vector graphics file format with wide application support, however the Faint support for SVG is currently
very limited.

== Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf) ==
A vector format for documents. This format should be used for output
when vector images are to be used in a PDF (created with for example
pdflatex).
