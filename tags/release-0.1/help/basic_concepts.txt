This help topic will familiarize you with the basics of Faint, and
especially things that may be different from other graphics
editors. You are recommended to at least read -rasterandobject- to
enable you to use Faint effectively.

== Raster and object graphics ==
label:rasterandobject
Faint has two modes: the 'Raster mode' and the 'Object mode' (or
'Vector mode'). The mode controls the output and behavior of drawing operations.
A Faint image can mix elements from both modes. By default, raster
graphics are at the bottom and object graphics are placed on top.

The current mode, which will affect the available -tools.txt- as well
as their output type (adjustable objects or static drawn pixels) is
selected with the 'Layer selection control' at the top of the
tool panel:\ image:img_layer_selection.png

Working in this mode is like drawing on paper - that which has been
drawn can be erased or drawn over but not easily adjusted.\

image:layer_vector.png *Selects the object mode.*\
To continue with silly analogies, the object mode is like extreme
scrap-booking. Anything drawn in object mode mode becomes a vector
object that can be selected, moved and scaled. These objects can,
however, not be manipulated on the pixel-level, therefore vector
graphics are practical for diagrams (floor plans, flow-charts), and
some types of drawings - but not for e.g. photographs or pixel art.\

When saving an image with object graphics, a vector file format, such
as SVG, should be used so the objects are preserved. Raster
file formats flatten the image. (See -formats.txt-).

The combination of object and raster graphics makes it possible to add
adjustable annotations such as text and arrows to raster images.\

== Selection ==
Faint features two types of selection: raster and object
selection. The raster selection selects a region in the raster
graphics, while object selection deals with complete objects. Raster
selection is only available in the raster mode, and Object selection
is only available in object mode. Some operations are only available
when a selection is active. For example, 'Delete' will replace the
selected raster area in the image with the background color or, for
object selection, remove all selected objects.

The raster selection is used to move, delete and copy parts of the
raster image.  The object selection is likewise used to move, delete
and copy objects. The object selection also allows changing properties
of the selected objects, such as line width or color.
