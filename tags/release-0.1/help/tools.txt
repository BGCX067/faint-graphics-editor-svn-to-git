= Tools =
The toolbar to the left of the main frame contains the tools that are used to
draw, or add objects to-, the drawing area.

Most tools are available in both the raster and object modes.\
To select a tool, click its button in the toolbar.  Most tools do their
thing when either mouse button is held with the cursor over the
drawing area and the mouse is moved.

Many of the tools use a foreground and a background color. If the
left mouse button is used for drawing, the primary color will be used
for foreground and the secondary for background.

== image:toolicon_rectsel.png Selection ==
label:tool_raster_selection
The Selection tool selects and moves/manipulates areas in the
image. Many commands behave differently when a selection is
active. For example, the "Crop" command will crop the image to the
selection if there is one, otherwise the command will perform
a -smart crop-.

*Settings*
|| image:choice_transparent.png || Transparent background: The selected background color will not be transferred when the selection is moved. ||
|| image:choice_opaque.png || Opaque background: The selected area will be transferred with all colors. The "hole" left behind a moved selection will receive the current background color."||

*Keyboard modifiers*
|| image:key_ctrl.png || If Ctrl is held when a selection is dragged, the selection will be copied. ||
|| image:key_shift.png || If shift is held when a selection is dragged, the drag will be constrained to horizontal or vertical lines. ||
