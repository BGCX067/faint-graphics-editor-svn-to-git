= Tools =
The toolbar to the left of the main frame contains the tools that are used to
draw, or add objects to-, the drawing area.

Most tools are available in both the raster and object modes.\
To select a tool, click its button in the toolbar.  Most tools do their
thing when either mouse button is held with the cursor over the
drawing area and the mouse is moved.

Many of the tools use a foreground and a background color. If the
left mouse button is used for drawing, the primary color will be used
for foreground and the secondary for background.

label:tool_raster_selection
== graphic:toolicon_rectsel.png Raster Selection ==
The Selection tool selects and moves/manipulates areas in the
image. Many commands behave differently when a selection is
active. For example, the "Crop" command will crop the image to the
selection if there is one, otherwise the command will perform
an -auto_crop,auto crop-.

*Settings*

|| graphic:alpha_blending.png || Alpha blending: When enabled, colors in the selection will blend with the background. When disabled, the colors from the selection will be copied as is to the background, including the alpha value. ||

*Keyboard modifiers*
|| image:key_ctrl.png || If Ctrl is held when a selection is dragged, the selection will be copied. ||
|| image:key_shift.png || If shift is held when a selection is dragged, the drag will be constrained to horizontal or vertical lines. ||

|| image:icon_info.png || Use Ctrl+Right\-Click inside the selection to quickly pick a color to treat as transparent. Ctrl+Right\-Click outside to select Opaque background. ||
