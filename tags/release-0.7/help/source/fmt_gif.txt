summary:"A lossless raster format with animation support."

== Graphics Interchange Format (.gif) ==
A lossless raster format with animation support.

The number of colors per frame is limited to 256, so gif is suitable
for simple sprites, or clipart - not photographs. When animation is
not required, png is generally a better alternative.
