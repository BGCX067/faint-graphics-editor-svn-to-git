#summary Feature overview
=Features=
These are the features that are currently implemented.

*Note:* This means they're implemented in trunk. The installers may be older.

See also [PlannedFeatures]

==Main features==
 * Supports both raster and vector graphics by a quick mode-switch - anything drawn in  raster mode becomes raster graphics, anything drawn in object mode becomes adjustable (vector-) objects
 * Raster graphics can be pasted in object mode and then become a scalable raster object
 * Patterns and gradients behave just like colors and can be used by all tools, added to the palette etc.
 * The image can be "picked" as a pattern which allows selective reverting, merging images, cloning and such.
 * Python scripting

==Tools==
 * Brush
 * Ellipse
 * Color picker
 * Flood-fill
 * Leveling (rotate to align points)
 * Line (and poly line)
 * Pen
 * Path (Work in progress)
 * Polygon
 * Rectangle
 * Selection
 * Spline
 * Text
 * Hot-spot (for cursors)
 * Coordinate system calibration
 * Tape measure (for image measurements)

==Object features==
 * Recursive grouping and ungrouping
 * Change Z-order
 * Resize, rotate, flip
 * Change settings (line width, text, font, colors)
 * Convert to path
 * Auto-measurements in text objects

==Filters==
 * Sharpen (Unsharp mask)
 * Gaussian blur
 * Brightness/Contrast
 * Threshold
 * Pixelize
 * Stroke (extra border)
 * Shadow
 * Pinch/Whirl
 * Invert
 * Quantize (color reduction)
 * Desaturate (color to grayscale)

==Other==
 * Arrowheads
 * Grid
 * Snapping to object corners, center and center-points of edges or the grid (not annoying!)
 * Splittable tabbed interface
 * Adjustable palette
 * Crop to selection
 * Auto crop
 * Endless undo
 * Length and angle information
 * Constrain-able drawing, e.g. ellipse to circle, line to 45 degree angle, to grid
 * Multiple color choices:
  * RGBA colors
  * Patterns
  * Gradients 
 * Animated gif support
 * Multi-image icon support

==Scripting==
 * Functions can be defined to automate common tasks or to select tools, styles and colors
 * Allows scripted drawing, practical for drawing e.g. grids etc, batch editing or updating text (like a date) in an image automatically
 * Functions can be bound to keys
 * Custom file formats can be added

==Expressions in text objects==
Text objects support expressions that refer to objects, for example:
"The rectangle area is \area(my_rectangle, mm2) mm\sq"

==Formats==
Loads many raster formats (as supported by wxWidgets). Also loads SVG with some success. Saves to:
 * png
 * jpg (No quality options yet)
 * svg
 * pdf (Limited support)
 * ico (Windows icon)
 * cur (Windows cursor)
 * gif
