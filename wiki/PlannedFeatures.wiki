#summary Planned features
=Planned features=
This page lists features that are planned and their status. Through huge effort and discipline some features have been put on hold so that a point for a reasonably stable first release can be reached.

== Custom objects ==
Support for adding objects, such as diagram elements, furniture or electronics could be nice, if I find a way to add it that doesn't feel like bloat. 

== Printing ==
Obviously required feature that I haven't gotten around to yet.

== Multiple-style text objects ==
I really want the text tool to support different fonts at different locations in the same block of text.

== Tablet feature support ==
Support for pressure and angle sensitive pen tablets would be nice. *Started!*

== File handling ==
 * Renaming and moving opened images
 * Set-able and Freezable start paths for load and save dialogs

= Vague fantastic ideas that might never happen =
 * Graph-like node linking/arranging
 * Flexible image-like palette option
 * Automatic "used colors" palette option
 * Mathematically described curves
