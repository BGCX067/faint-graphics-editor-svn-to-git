= MOVING =
Faint development has moved to github:
https://github.com/lukas-ke/faint-graphics-editor

*Note* These build instructions are outdated. See instead https://github.com/lukas-ke/faint-graphics-editor/blob/master/build/build-instructions-linux.md

= Building Faint on Linux =
For simplicity, this guide assumes that the path "~/dev" is used for
wxWidgets and for Faint.

= 1. wxWidgets =
wxWidgets is the GUI toolkit used for Faint.

== Check out the wxWidgets trunk ==
{{{
cd ~/dev
svn checkout http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/trunk wxWidgets
}}}

== Build wxWidgets ==
{{{
cd ~/dev/wxWidgets
./configure --disable-shared --enable-monolithic --enable-aui
make
}}}

= 2. Python = 
Python is used for generating some code when building Faint, as a
build script and as the embedded scripting language of Faint.

== Install the Python dev-files ==
Python3.4 + development headers are required.
{{{
sudo apt-get install python3.4
sudo apt-get install python3.4-dev

}}}

= 3. Various dependencies =
You may also need to get these packages:
 * build-essentials  
 * gtk+-2.0

*Note:* Either gcc-4.9 or clang-3.6 (or later) are required (C++14-support).

= 4. Faint =
Finally!

== Check out Faint ==
{{{
cd ~/dev
svn co http://faint-graphics-editor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ faint-graphics-editor
}}}

== Create build.cfg ==
The file build.cfg contains paths to Faint-depdendencies. Generate the config file as follows:
{{{
cd ~/dev/faint-graphics-editor/build
python3 build.py
}}}

This creates build.cfg. Edit it so that it points out dependencies
correctly, example:
{{{
[folders]
wx_root=~/dev/wxWidgets
cairo_include=/usr/include/cairo
cairo_lib=
python_include=/usr/include/python3.4
python_lib=/usr/lib/python3.4/config-3.4m-i386-linux-gnu
pango_include=/usr/include/pango-1.0
pango_lib=
glib_include=/usr/include/glib-2.0
glib_lib=
glib_config_include=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include
}}}

== Build Faint ==
Run build.py again to build faint:
{{{
cd ~/dev/faint-graphics-editor/build
python3 build.py
}}}

== Start Faint ==
{{{
cd ~/dev/faint-graphics-editor
./faint 
}}}
