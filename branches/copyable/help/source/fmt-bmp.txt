= Bitmap (.bmp) =
The BMP file format is an uncompressed raster format. Faint can save
either 24 bit-per-pixel bitmaps, or 8-bit-per-pixel color or grayscale
bitmaps (available as different options in the file dialog).

Bitmaps often have unduly large file sizes, so for drawings,
\ref(fmt-png.txt,PNG) is usually a better alternative. For
photographs, depending on quality requirements, \ref(fmt-jpg.txt,JPG)
may be a better alternative.

== 256 color bitmap ==
When saving as 8bpp color, the saved image will be
\ref(feat-quantize.txt,quantized) if the current number of colors
exceeds 256.

== Grayscale bitmap ==
When saving as 8bpp grayscale, the saved image is desaturated using
unweighted desaturation. If weighted desaturation is required, the
image should be desaturated manually first (see \ref(feat-desaturate.txt)).
