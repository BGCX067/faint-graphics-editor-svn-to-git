summary:"Class representing in-memory bitmaps"

= Bitmap =
\image(py_detached_copy.png)

The Bitmap class represents in-memory bitmaps. Instances of this class
contain their pixel data, unlike \ref(py-canvas.txt,Canvas)-objects which
always reference an image in a tab. Bitmaps therefore do not support
undo or redo, but instead allow more effective scripted access.

See also \ref(py-canvas.txt) for editing of images opened in tabs and
\ref(py-pattern.txt) for using bitmaps as fill colors.
