= Selection =
Faint features two types of selection: raster and object
selection. The raster selection selects a region in the raster
graphics, while object selection deals with complete objects. Some
operations are only available when a selection is active. For example,
'Delete' will replace the selected raster area in the image with the
background color or, for object selection, remove all selected
objects.

\imagemap(selection_tools.map)
To modify the raster selection, use the
\ref(tool-raster-selection.txt,raster selection tool). To modify the
raster selection, use the
\ref(tool-object-selection.txt,object selection tool).\br

The raster selection is used to move, delete and copy parts of the
raster image.  The object selection is likewise used to move, delete
and copy objects. The object selection also allows changing properties
of the selected objects, such as line width or color.
