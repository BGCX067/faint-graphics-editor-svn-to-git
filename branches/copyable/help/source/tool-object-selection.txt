The Object Selection tool is used to select, move, resize, rotate and
otherwise adjust objects.

To select an object, click inside it. To deselect all objects, click
outside. Hold Ctrl to select multiple objects, or click
outside objects, hold the mouse and drag to select all objects within
a rectangle.

*Settings*\br
||\image(objselectsettings.png)|| The Object Selection tool makes the settings of all selected objects editable.\brWhen a setting is changed, the selected objects will be adjusted. Note that the current drawing settings will remain unchanged.||
||\graphic(edit-points.png)|| When an object with editable points is selected, this setting toggles between point editing and resizing. ||

*Keyboard modifiers*
||\image(key_ctrl.png)|| If Ctrl is held when the selected objects are dragged, the objects will be copied instead of moved.\brIf Ctrl is held when starting a resize, the object will be rotated instead.||
||\image(key_shift.png)||When dragging objects, Shift constrains the drag to horizontal and vertical lines.\brWhen resizing, Shift keeps the object proportions.\brWhen rotating, Shift constrains to certain angles.||
