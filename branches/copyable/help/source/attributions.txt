== Code and algorithms ==
This section lists originators of external source code used in
Faint.

=== Cubic bézier arc algorithm ===
The algorithm Faint uses for computing arc paths is based on the
document "Drawing an elliptical arc using polylines, quadratic or
cubic Bézier curves" and the source file "EllipticalArc.java" by
L. Maisonobe of \extref(http://spaceroots.org).

His originals are available here: br

=== Color quantization ===
The color quantization Faint uses for reducing colors is based on code
from Leptonica, \extref(http://www.leptonica.com). \br
