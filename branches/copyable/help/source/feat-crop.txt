= Crop =
Cropping shrinks the image or certain selected objects.

== Method ==
* Menu: Edit->Crop (Ctrl+Alt+C)
* Python: withbind:context_crop();

== Details ==
There are three cropping methods: auto crop, crop to raster selection and crop objects.

label:auto_crop
*Auto crop:* If no selection is active, the image is cropped automatically by
removing contiguous colors from the edges.

|| \image(feat_autocrop_pre.png)||\image(feat_autocrop_post.png)||
|| No selection, raster mode || Ctrl+Alt+C auto-crops ||
Auto-crop supports \ref(feat-dwim-auto-crop.txt,DWIM) after
cropping ambiguously.

*Crop to raster selection:* Crop will remove everything outside the selection.

||\image(feat_crop_raster_pre.png)||\image(feat_crop_raster_post.png)||
|| A raster selection is active || Ctrl+Alt+C crops away everything outside the selection ||

*Crop objects:* Crop will be performed on each object if used with an
object selection. Object crop is supported by Text Regions and Raster
Objects.

||\image(feat_crop_objects_pre.png)||\image(feat_crop_objects_post.png)||
|| A raster object, an ellipse and two text objects are selected. || Ctrl+Alt+C crops the raster object and resizes the text objects. ||
