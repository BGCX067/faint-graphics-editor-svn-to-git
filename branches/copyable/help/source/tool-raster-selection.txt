The Selection tool selects and moves/manipulates areas in the
image. Many commands behave differently when a selection is
active. For example, the "Crop" command will crop the image to the
selection if there is one, otherwise the command will perform
an \ref(auto_crop,auto crop).

*Settings*
||\graphic(choice-transparent.png)|| Transparent background: The selected background color will not be transferred when the selection is moved. ||
||\graphic(choice-opaque.png)|| Opaque background: The selected area will be transferred with all colors. The "hole" left behind a moved selection will receive the current background color.||
||\graphic(alpha-blending.png)|| Alpha blending: When enabled, colors in the selection will blend with the background. When disabled, the colors from the selection will be copied as is to the background, including the alpha value. ||

*Keyboard modifiers*
||\image(key_ctrl.png)|| If Ctrl is held when a selection is dragged, the selection will be copied. ||
||\image(key_shift.png)|| If shift is held when a selection is dragged, the drag will be constrained to horizontal or vertical lines. ||

||\image(icon_info.png)|| Use Ctrl+Right-Click inside the selection to quickly pick a color to treat as transparent. Ctrl+Right-Click outside to select Opaque background. ||
|| || See \ref(feat-dwim-delete.txt) for a quick way to clear an area with the surrounding color ||
