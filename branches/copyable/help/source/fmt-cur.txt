= Windows cursor (.cur) =
A format for application cursors on Microsoft Windows. A cursor
consists of one or more images of different size and color depths to
provide variants for different situations. The width and height of
cursors is limited to 256 pixels.

== Hot spot ==
Cursor files have a hot spot which specifies which point should anchor
at the pointer coordinate. In Faint, the hot spot can currently only
be modified from the Python interpreter, using frame.get_hotspot
and frame.set_hotspot (see \ref(py-frame.txt)).
