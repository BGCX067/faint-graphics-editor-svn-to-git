= Adding file formats =
New file formats for loading and saving can be added with the
add_format function.

The above example defines a load function and a save function for
files with the extension ".silly". This format is indeed silly,
as the load-function simply adds a frame with a single text object
showing the name of the loaded file and the save-function only writes
the type name of each object to the file.

After the call to add_format, the added format will be an option for
loading and saving via the file dialog (as well as all other ways of
loading files, such as drag and drop or via the command line).
