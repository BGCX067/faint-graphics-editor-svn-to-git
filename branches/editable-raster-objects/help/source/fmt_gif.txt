= Graphics Interchange Format (.gif) =
A lossless raster format with animation support.

The number of colors per frame is limited to 256, so GIF is suitable
for simple sprites, or clipart - not photographs. When animation is
not required, \ref(fmt_png.txt,PNG) is generally a better alternative.

|| image:icon_work_in_progress.png || *Note*: The quantization Faint uses when saving a GIF is limited, also only the first frame delay is used. ||

== Frame delay ==
The frame delay for an image to be saved as a GIF can currently only
be set from the Python interpreter.

*Image method*
|| image.set_frame_delay( frame, delay ) || Sets the delay for the specified frame to 'delay', specified in hundredths of a second. ||
