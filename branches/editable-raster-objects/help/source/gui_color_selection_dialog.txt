= Color Selection Dialog =
The color selection dialog is used for configuring \ref(color.txt,colors) (..and patterns and gradients). The dialog can adjust colors in the
palette as well as the selected primary and secondary color.

To edit a palette color with this dialog, double-click a color in the
\ref(gui_color_panel.txt). To edit the current foreground or background, single-click one of those in the \ref(gui_selected_color_control.txt).

The color selection dialog is divided in separate tabs for selecting
either a single RGBA-color, a gradient or a bitmap pattern. When the
dialog is closed (OK), the selection in the currently shown tab will
be used (i.e. either a color, a gradient or a pattern).

||W||Show the Gradient-tab||
||E||Show the Pattern-tab||

== The HSL tab (single color) ==
The HSL tab is used to specify an RGBA color, either using the
hue/saturation control and the lightness slider or the HSL or RGBA
entry fields.

== The Gradient Tab ==
The gradient tab has controls for specifying the color stops of a
linear or radial gradient. The angle of linear gradients can be
adjusted, by clicking the gradient control and adjusting the
angle-indicating line.

The color-stop editing is common to linear and radial gradients: the
handles below the gradient represent color stops. These can be moved
by clicking and dragging them. To clone a color stop, hold Ctrl when
dragging it. Right click a handle to adjust its color.
Ctrl+Right-click a handle to delete it.

== The Pattern Tab ==
The pattern tab allows pasting a bitmap from the clipboard to use as
pattern, retrieving the active image as a pattern and copying the
current pattern to the clipboard.

*Keyboard shortcuts*
||Ctrl+C||Copy the pattern to the clipboard||
||Ctrl+V||Use the clipboard content as pattern||
