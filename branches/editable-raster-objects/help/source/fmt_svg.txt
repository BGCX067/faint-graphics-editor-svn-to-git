= Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg) =
A format for Vector images. Faint also saves the background (if not single color) as an embedded PNG, so
SVG is a suitable for storing images with both vector and raster elements. Note that images saved from
Faint with embedded raster graphics can cause rather large SVG files.
