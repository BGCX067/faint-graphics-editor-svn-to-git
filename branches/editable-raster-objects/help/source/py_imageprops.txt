= ImageProps =

ImageProps instances are passed to load-functions that have been
added with add_format when loading a file type matching that format.

The ImageProps objects are the interface to the new image while
loading, and is used to add and retrieve FrameProps and to signal
errors and warnings.

ImageProps objects merely contain the frames, while
\ref(py_frameprops.txt) objects are used to modify the pixel data or
object content while loading. For animated formats, one FrameProps
should be created for each frame. Load functions for unanimated
formats must use add_frame once to create a FrameProps to access their
single frame.
