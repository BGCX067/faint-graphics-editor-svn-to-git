= Portable Document Format (.pdf) =
A document format. Faint has limited PDF support, which can be used to
save vector graphics for inclusion in PDF-documents generated with for
example pdflatex. In other situations, \ref(fmt_svg.txt,SVG) is
preferable when saving vector images from Faint.

Faint can open the PDF:s it has saved, but not PDF:s from other
applications.
