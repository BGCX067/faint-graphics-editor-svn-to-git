= Resize objects =
Objects in Faint can be resized with the \ref(feat_resize_objects_tool,object selection tool), the \ref(feat_resize_objects_dialog,resize dialog) or \ref(feat_resize_objects_scripting,scripting).

label:feat_resize_objects_tool
== Using the Object Selection tool ==
When the object selection tool is active, and objects are selected,
handles for resizing are shown at the object bounding box.  To use the
handles for resizing diagonally, click them and drag:

|| Resize handles || Their directions ||

The area on the line between two handles can be used to
resize only horizontally or only vertically:

Rotated objects can be resized aligned with the image or the object.
To switch between image and object aligned resizing for an object,
select the object and right-click inside the object.

|| Image aligned || Object aligned ||

Image aligned resizing, unless proportional, will skew rotated objects.

*Modifiers*

|| image:mouse_right.png || Right click inside objects to toggle alignment ||
