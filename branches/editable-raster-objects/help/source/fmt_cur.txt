= Windows Cursor (.cur) =
A format for application cursors on Microsoft Windows. A cursor
consists of one or more images of different size and color depths to
provide variants for different situations. The width and height of
cursors is limited to 256 pixels.

Cursors have a Hot-spot for specifying which point is the focus. In
Faint, the Hot-spot can currently only be modified from the Python
interpreter, using image.get_frame_hotspot and
image.set_frame_hotspot.
