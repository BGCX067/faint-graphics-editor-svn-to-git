label:color
Faint features a primary and a secondary color choice.\br
image:selected_color_control.png

The primary color is (normally) used for drawing lines, and borders of shapes,
while the secondary color is used for filling.

To select the primary color, left click a color in the palette. To select the
secondary color, right click in the palette.\br
image:color_palette.png

Single-click either the primary or the secondary color in the selected
color control to adjust the color freely in the
\ref(gui_color_selection_dialog.txt). Double click a color in the palette
to adjust it with the color selection dialog. Colors can also be
selected with the \ref(tool_picker).

== Alpha ==
label:color_rgba
Faint uses RGBA-colors. That is, colors are defined by their relative
amounts of red, green and blue with an additional 'alpha component'
controlling the degree of translucency. With an alpha of 0, a color is
completely transparent, with an alpha of 255 it is completely opaque.

Faint indicates alpha by blending against a checkered pattern.
|| image:color_0_alpha.png || Fully transparent (alpha=0) ||
|| image:color_128_alpha.png || Half transparent (alpha=128) ||
|| image:color_255_alpha.png || Fully opaque (alpha=255) ||

When the checkered pattern appears in the palette or selected color
control, it indicates the alpha of that color. When the checkered
pattern is visible in the image, it means that the image will be
partially transparent in that area (if saved to a
\ref(formats.txt,file format) that supports alpha).

== Gradients ==
label:color_gradient
Gradient transitions can be used as the primary or secondary "color".
Faint indicates a gradient color item in the palette or as a selected color
by rendering the gradient, like this: image:color_gradient_icon.png \br

|| image:color_draw_with_gradient.png ||
|| 'Objects filled with gradients' ||

Gradients can be configured in the \ref(gui_color_selection_dialog.txt) or
using the Python-function 'set_fg'.

== Patterns ==
label:color_pattern
Image patterns can be used instead of colors. Faint indicates patterns
with this icon: image:color_pattern_icon.png \br

Patterns are repeated where drawn, and can also be used for various
image effects. Use the \ref(gui_color_selection_dialog.txt) or the
\ref(tool_picker) to select an image to use as a pattern.
|| image:color_draw_with_pattern.png ||
|| 'Drawing with a pattern' ||

The pattern feature allows an editing trick. By using the edited image
as the pattern, the image state is stored as a color and can be
selectively reverted using any of the drawing tools.
