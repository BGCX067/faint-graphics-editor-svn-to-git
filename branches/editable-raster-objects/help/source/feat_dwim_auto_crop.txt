summary:"Toggle which region is auto-cropped to, after the fact"

= Do-What-I-Mean Auto-Crop =
Sometimes when using \ref(auto_crop,auto crop), two regions are equally
likely targets. The DWIM-Auto-Crop feature is used after cropping
removes the wrong region, to crop to the opposite side instead.

== Method ==
After performing an auto-crop, use
* Python: withbind:dwim();

== Example ==
An image with two equally croppable sides:
|| image:feat_dwim_auto_crop_1.png ||

The result after an initial auto-crop:
|| image:feat_dwim_auto_crop_2.png ||

By applying DWIM-Auto-Crop after cropping, the image is cropped from the
left side instead:
