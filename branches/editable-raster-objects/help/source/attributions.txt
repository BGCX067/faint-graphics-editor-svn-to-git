== Code and algorithms ==
=== Cubic bézier arc algorithm ===

The algorithm Faint uses for computing arc paths is based on the
document "Drawing an elliptical arc using polylines, quadratic or
cubic Bézier curves" and the source file "EllipticalArc.java" by
L. Maisonobe of \extref(http://spaceroots.org).

His originals are available here: br
