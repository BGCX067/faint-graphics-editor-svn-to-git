Instances of the Canvas class are used to modify an image opened in
Faint. Modifications to an image through the Canvas interface are
undoable actions, just like the manual image editing.

|| image:icon_info.png || The undo/redo overhead for each action makes the Canvas interface unsuitable for per-pixel modification. See instead \ref(py_bitmap.txt). ||
