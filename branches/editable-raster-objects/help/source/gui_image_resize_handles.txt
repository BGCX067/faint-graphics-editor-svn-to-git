The image resize handles, outside the drawing area, are used to scale the image or resize the
drawing area interactively.

|| The resize handles, with the pointer\br over the top-left handle (diagonal resizing) ||

To resize or rescale, click one of the handles, hold the button down and drag
the mouse.

Use the left button to *resize* (expand or shrink) the drawing
area. The secondary color will fill the expanded region. Hold shift to
resize proportionally.

To *scale* the image contents, use the right mouse button. Hold down
shift for proportional resize. Hold down control to use nearest
neighbour scaling (disables color blending).

|| image:key_shift.png || Keep proportions ||

== DWIM resize ==
Use \ref(feat_dwim_resize.txt,DWIM) bind:dwim; after expanding the drawing
area to expand with the most prominent edge color, instead of the secondary color.
