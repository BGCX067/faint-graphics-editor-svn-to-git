FrameProps instances are used in load-functions that have been
added with add_format when loading a file type matching that format.

FrameProps objects are created with the
add_frame-method of \ref(py_imageprops.txt,ImageProps) objects, and are used to load frames (or images). The pixel
and object data for a frame can be modified using the FrameProps.
